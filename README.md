**Craft to Exile \[Harmony]** is a modpack designed around exploration. Mods in the modpack aim to enhance the players' experience with Age of Exile - a thorough RPG mod dedicated to exploration. This mod draws inspiration from popular action RPGs such as Diablo II and Path of Exile.

At its core, Craft to Exile modpacks turn Minecraft into action RPGs which focus on exploration, character developmentr, and looting. However, [Dissonance] and [Harmony] both have different philosophies regarding their development. Although [Harmony] came after, and runs on a newer Minecraft version, it is NOT 'better'. Consider both modpacks sisters to each other. [Harmony] takes advantage of Age of Exile's intrinsic compatibility with vanilla and other mods. Representative of its namesake, it provides player with an experience more akin to a vanilla experience than [Dissonance]. [Harmony] focuses on smaller excursions and a focal main base. Every so often, mobs will invade you. To accompany this, mobs scale with your level in every dimension (including the Overworld). Rather than limit dimensions to a narrow level range, in [Harmony], all dimensions have the potential of reaching max level. On the other hand, [Dissonance] was the first of the two packs and features a more linearalized progression ideology. [Dissonance] boasts a very impressive talent and skill tree. On the contrary, [Harmony] drops both of these trees in favour of 'skill gems' which grant the player skills when socketed into equipment. Another one of [Dissonance]'s main hallmarks is its fleshed out quest log which guides you through the dimensions and provides with a clear goal. After all, a resolution can only be found when there is dissonance.

**TL;DR** - If you're looking for a more streamlined progression system with more depth to character customization, then I suggest you pick [Dissonance]. If you're looking for a more vanilla-esque experience with strong ARPG elements, or the idea of defending your base from mobs every few nights appeals to you, then pick [Harmony]. It's worth noting that in terms of resources, [Harmony] is much lighter.

In the end, you can't really go wrong with either decision and you're welcome to try both! Official servers are provided for both Craft to Exile packs!
